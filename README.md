##Movie Catalog Application
###This is an hands on attempt to learn more about Microservices and how do you implement them in Java. 

Here, is the link to the presentation where I have summarized the basics of Microservice Architecture and details of its components. My aim here is to learn about the basics of microservice in Java and service discovery using Eureka server by implementing a movie catalog application. Movie catalog application is for movies, similar to the way GoodReads is for the books.Now the first step is to go over the architecture. I will be creating 3 microservices, one for catalogging the movies which takes the results from rating data and movie details services.
